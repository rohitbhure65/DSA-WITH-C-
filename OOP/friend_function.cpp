// ‚óè Friend Function : Friend function acts as a friend of the class. It can access
// the private and protected members of the class. The friend function is not
// a member of the class, but it must be listed in the class definition. The
// non-member function cannot access the private data of the class.
// Sometimes, it is necessary for the non-member function to access the data.

// The friend function is a non-member function and has the ability to
// access the private data of the class.

// Note :
// 1. A friend function cannot access the private members directly, it has
// to use an object name and dot operator with each member name.
// 2. Friend function uses objects as arguments.
