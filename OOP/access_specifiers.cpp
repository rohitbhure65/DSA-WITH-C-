// ‚óè Access Specifiers IMP : The access specifiers are used to define how functions
// and variables can be accessed outside the class. There are three types of
// access specifiers:

// 1. Private: Functions and variables declared as private can be accessed only
// within the same class, and they cannot be accessed outside the class they
// are declared.
// 2. Public: Functions and variables declared under public can be accessed from
// anywhere.
// 3. Protected: Functions and variables declared as protected cannot be
// accessed outside the class except a child class. This specifier is generally
// used in inheritance.
