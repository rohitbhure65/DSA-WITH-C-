// ‚óè Abstraction
// We try to obtain an abstract view, model or structure of a real life problem,
// and reduce its unnecessary details. With definition of properties of
// problems, including the data which are affected and the operations which
// are identified, the model abstracted from problems can be a standard
// solution to this type of problems. It is an efficient way since there are
// nebulous real-life problems that have similar properties.
